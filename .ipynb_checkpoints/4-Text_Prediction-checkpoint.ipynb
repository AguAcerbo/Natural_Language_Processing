Yo no quiero ser, El único que sabe Que alguien podría venir y apenas Dicen que el amor por mí, Estoy de pie temblando de tierra, Y estoy pensando que voy a perder, Estribillo: Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza, Estoy perdiendo mi mente, Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez. Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza, Estoy perdiendo mi mente, Estoy perdiendo a mi manera, Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. ¿Estás hablando conmigo? Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver, Pero es que lo que Siente esto debe ser. Mi amor es como bala Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda. No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo, Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más. Hasta que me aviso, Necesito saber en este momento Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo: Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza, Estoy perdiendo mi mente, Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez. Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza, Estoy perdiendo mi mente, Estoy perdiendo a mi manera, Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ... Pero chica que me pone nervioso, A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta. ¿Y qué va a tomar Para la celestial ... Me estás volviendo loco!
